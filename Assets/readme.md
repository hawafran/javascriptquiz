This quiz was created using quiz questions from w3 schools. the application begins with a "start" page where the user can click to begin the quiz. When the question page loads, there is a time that begins counting down from 60 seconds. the user can then progress through the quiz using the same method by clicking on the answer. If the user gets a question wrong the timer decreases by 1 second, but if the user gets a question correct the score is added by 1 point. The application is then supposed to save the score and allow the user to save their score and initials in the localstorage (the code is written but us not working correctly).
